# Insider trading and security performance

Goal: study historical instances of insider trading and correlate to security's subsequent performance

Tools / Requirements:
 - Given a security and a start date, return the ROI for different time intervals (ex. 3, 6, 12 months)
 - Measure to standardized to market/sector performance
 
Assumptions:
 - The market/sector adjusted returns will give us a good indication of the security's output

Metrics:
 - Magnitude of insider trading relative to market cap: 10M shares traded of 1B company = roughly 1% market cap traded
 - Duration: look at the same subset of data over different time intervals

Further study:
 - Analyze causality by sector
 - Subsets of insider trading by market cap
 - Changing time since trade to assess security performance
